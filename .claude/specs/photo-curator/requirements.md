# Photo Curator Requirements

## Feature Overview
Smart photo curation system that clusters similar photos and selects the best shots from trip photos using Vision Framework. The system transforms hundreds of vacation photos into a curated selection of 5-20 best shots based on visual similarity, technical quality, and contextual relevance.

## Code Reuse Analysis
Based on the existing codebase analysis:
- **New iOS Project**: No existing implementation found - will build from scratch
- **Architecture Foundation**: Leverage the detailed technical vision from `vision.md` 
- **Project Structure**: Follow the established project structure outlined in `README.md`
- **Frameworks**: Build on Vision Framework, PhotoKit, and Core ML as specified

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Photo Library Access and Import
**User Story:** As a user, I want to import my trip photos from the photo library so that I can curate them automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL request photo library access permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a photo library browser
3. WHEN the user selects photos THEN the system SHALL import them for processing
4. IF the user denies permissions THEN the system SHALL display an informative message about app functionality
5. WHEN importing photos THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including timestamp, location, and EXIF data

### Requirement 2: Visual Similarity Clustering
**User Story:** As a user, I want similar photos to be grouped together so that I don't have to manually sort through duplicate shots.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN photos are imported THEN the system SHALL generate visual fingerprints using Vision Framework
2. WHEN fingerprints are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate similarity scores between photos
3. WHEN similarity exceeds 0.75 threshold THEN photos SHALL be grouped into the same cluster
4. WHEN clustering photos THEN the system SHALL consider time proximity (10-minute window)
5. WHEN location data exists THEN the system SHALL include 50-meter radius grouping
6. WHEN cluster size exceeds 20 photos THEN the system SHALL create additional sub-clusters

### Requirement 3: Technical Quality Analysis
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to identify the highest quality photos so that blurry or poorly exposed shots are filtered out.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing photos THEN the system SHALL calculate sharpness scores using Laplacian variance
2. WHEN analyzing photos THEN the system SHALL evaluate exposure quality through histogram analysis
3. WHEN analyzing photos THEN the system SHALL assess composition using Vision Framework saliency
4. WHEN technical analysis completes THEN each photo SHALL receive a quality score from 0-1
5. IF analysis fails for any photo THEN the system SHALL assign a neutral score of 0.5

### Requirement 4: Face Quality Detection
**User Story:** As a user, I want photos with better face quality (open eyes, good expressions) to be prioritized so that group photos look their best.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing photos with faces THEN the system SHALL detect face rectangles and landmarks
2. WHEN face landmarks are detected THEN the system SHALL check eye state (open/closed)
3. WHEN face landmarks are detected THEN the system SHALL detect smile presence
4. WHEN analyzing faces THEN the system SHALL calculate face angle and size scores
5. WHEN no faces are detected THEN the system SHALL assign a neutral face score

### Requirement 5: Smart Photo Selection
**User Story:** As a user, I want the best photo selected from each cluster so that I get one high-quality representative from each scene.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN clusters are formed THEN the system SHALL score each photo using weighted criteria
2. WHEN photos contain multiple faces THEN face quality SHALL be weighted at 50%
3. WHEN photos are landscapes THEN technical quality SHALL be weighted at 50%
4. WHEN scoring completes THEN the highest-scoring photo from each cluster SHALL be selected
5. WHEN contextual factors exist (golden hour, social context) THEN scores SHALL be adjusted accordingly

### Requirement 6: Recommendation Generation
**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive curated recommendations (top 5 overall, person-specific selections) so that I can quickly find the best photos for sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN photo selection completes THEN the system SHALL generate top 5 overall recommendations
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL create a diverse set of 10 photos
3. WHEN faces are detected THEN the system SHALL group photos by recognized persons
4. WHEN person groups exist THEN the system SHALL generate top 5 photos per person
5. WHEN recommendations are ready THEN the system SHALL present them in an organized interface

### Requirement 7: Performance and Memory Management  
**User Story:** As a user, I want photo processing to be fast and not crash my device so that I can curate large photo sets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing 100 photos THEN the system SHALL complete analysis in under 10 seconds
2. WHEN analyzing photos THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 200MB
3. WHEN processing large batches THEN photos SHALL be processed in groups of 20-50
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN feature prints and scores SHALL be cached for reuse
5. IF memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation

### Requirement 8: Data Persistence and Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want my analysis results saved so that I don't have to reprocess the same photos repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN photo analysis completes THEN results SHALL be stored locally using Core Data
2. WHEN photos are deleted THEN associated analysis data SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN new photos are added THEN only new photos SHALL be analyzed incrementally
4. WHEN the app restarts THEN previous analysis results SHALL be loaded from storage
5. WHEN storage cleanup occurs THEN orphaned data SHALL be removed automatically

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements  
- Process 100 photos in under 10 seconds
- Memory usage under 200MB during processing
- Smooth UI interactions during background processing

### Quality Requirements
- Clustering precision > 90%
- Quality scoring correlation with human judgment > 0.8
- Face detection false positive rate < 5%

### Compatibility Requirements
- iOS 16+ support (Vision Framework, PhotoKit)
- iPhone and iPad compatibility
- Support for HEIC, JPEG, and other standard photo formats

### Privacy Requirements
- All processing occurs on-device
- No photo data transmitted to external servers
- User consent required for photo library access

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Apple's Vision Framework for image analysis
- Must integrate with PhotoKit for photo library access
- Must support standard iOS photo formats and metadata
- Must handle memory constraints gracefully

## Success Criteria
- 85%+ user satisfaction with top 5 recommendations
- Users process 80%+ of their trip photos with the system
- 70%+ user retention for second usage session
- Technical performance meets all specified thresholds
