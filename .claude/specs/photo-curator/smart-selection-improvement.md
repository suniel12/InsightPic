# Smart Photo Selection Engine Improvement

## Task: Enhanced Cluster-Based Recommendation System

### Problem Statement
Current recommendation engine is primitive - it simply takes the first photo from each cluster instead of intelligently selecting the best quality photo from each cluster.

### Goal
Implement a truly smart selection engine that:
1. **Step 1**: Finds the highest quality photo from each cluster (e.g., 15 clusters → 15 cluster winners)
2. **Step 2**: From those cluster winners, selects the overall best 5-10 photos for final recommendations

### Current State
- ❌ `getBestPhotoFromCluster()` returns `cluster.photos.first`
- ❌ No quality-based selection within clusters
- ❌ No smart final selection from cluster winners

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Smart Cluster Selection
- Implement proper `getBestPhotoFromCluster()` using quality scores
- Add content-aware weighting (faces vs landscapes)
- Consider context factors (golden hour, uniqueness)

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Final Selection
- From cluster winners, select top 5-10 based on diversity
- Ensure variety in content types (not all portraits or all landscapes)
- Consider temporal spread across the trip

#### Phase 3: User Control
- Allow users to adjust selection criteria
- Provide options for conservative vs adventurous selection
- Show why each photo was selected

### Success Criteria
- Selects genuinely better photos from clusters based on quality metrics
- Final recommendations show diverse, high-quality representation of the trip
- User can understand and control the selection process
