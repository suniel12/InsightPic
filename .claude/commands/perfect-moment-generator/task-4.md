## Usage


## Instructions
This command executes a specific task from the perfect-moment-generator specification.

**Automatic Execution**: This command will automatically execute:


**Process**:
1. Load the perfect-moment-generator specification context (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
2. Execute task 4: "Implement Perfect Moment Compositor Service"
3. **Prioritize code reuse**: Use existing components and utilities identified above
4. Follow all implementation guidelines from the main /spec-execute command
5. Mark the task as complete in tasks.md
6. Stop and wait for user review

**Important**: This command follows the same rules as /spec-execute:
- Execute ONLY this specific task
- **Leverage existing code** whenever possible to avoid rebuilding functionality
- Mark task as complete by changing [ ] to [x] in tasks.md
- Stop after completion and wait for user approval
- Do not automatically proceed to the next task

## Next Steps
After task completion, you can:
- Review the implementation
- Run tests if applicable
- Execute the next task using /perfect-moment-generator-task-[next-id]
- Check overall progress with /spec-status perfect-moment-generator
